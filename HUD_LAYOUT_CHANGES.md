# HUD Layout Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Health/Mana/Energy Bar Positioning

**Problem**: The health, mana, and energy bars were positioned far from the portrait using `justify-between`, which separated them across the full width.

**Solution**: Modified `src/components/HUD/HUD.css`:
- Removed `justify-between` from `.hud-layout`
- Added fixed `gap: 12px` to position bars directly next to the portrait
- Added responsive gap adjustments for smaller screens:
  - Desktop: 12px gap
  - Tablet (768px): 8px gap  
  - Mobile (480px): 6px gap
  - Small mobile (320px): 4px gap

### 2. Character and Menu Button Spacing

**Problem**: Insufficient space between the character panel icon and menu icon buttons.

**Solution**: Modified `style.css`:
- Increased character button's `right` position from `calc(var(--container-padding) * 4)` to `calc(var(--container-padding) * 6)`
- Updated responsive styles:
  - Tablet (768px): Increased from 48px to 60px spacing
  - Mobile (480px): Increased from 40px to 48px spacing

## File Changes

### `src/components/HUD/HUD.css`
```css
.hud-layout {
  @apply fixed top-0 left-0 w-full h-full pointer-events-none z-[1000];
  @apply flex items-start; /* Removed justify-between */
  @apply p-hud;
  
  /* Added fixed gap for portrait-to-bars spacing */
  gap: 12px;
  
  /* Viewport-coordinated scaling */
  transform: scale(var(--viewport-scale, 1));
  transform-origin: top left;
}

/* Responsive gap adjustments */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hud-layout {
    gap: 8px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .hud-layout {
    gap: 6px;
  }
}

@media (max-width: 320px) {
  .hud-layout {
    gap: 4px;
  }
}
```

### `style.css`
```css
#character_panel_icon {
  /* Increased spacing between character and menu buttons */
  right: calc(var(--container-padding) * 6); /* Was * 4 */
}

/* Responsive adjustments */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  #character_panel_icon {
    right: 60px; /* Was 48px */
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  #character_panel_icon {
    right: 48px; /* Was 40px */
  }
}
```

## Visual Result

- **Health/Mana/Energy bars** now appear directly adjacent to the character portrait
- **Character and Menu buttons** have increased spacing between them for better visual separation
- **Responsive design** maintains proper proportions across all screen sizes
- **Layout is more compact** and intuitive for user interaction

## Technical Details

- Uses CSS Grid gap property for consistent spacing
- Maintains viewport scaling for different screen sizes
- Preserves all existing animations and hover effects
- Compatible with existing HUD manager and React rendering system
